Your TUF B550-PLUS motherboard does not have a dedicated EXT_FAN header. That’s the problem. This board was designed more for general users, not full-blown enthusiast setups.

So, you can’t use the 3-pin PC-IN connector from the extension card to connect to the motherboard. There's no matching EXT_FAN header. Without it, the card won’t communicate RPMs or allow fan control via BIOS.

BUT — you can still make it work dumb-mode: just power the fans and they’ll run at default speeds or voltage-controlled only.

🛠️ Here's What You Can Do:
1. Fans → 3-pin headers on the fan extension card
Plug your chassis fans into the 3-pin headers on the card.

2. 4-pin Molex (POWER12V) → PSU
This is mandatory. Without it, nothing spins.

Connect a Molex from your PSU to the extension card’s POWER12V.

This powers the fans independently of the motherboard.

3. Forget the 3-pin PC-IN
Your motherboard doesn’t have the right header for it.

That means:

No fan control from BIOS.

No fan monitoring in software (unless you're using a controller hub with USB or other integration).

Fans will run at default/full speed unless you're using voltage-based fan models and some fan controller inline.

🧼 Clean Setup Tip:
If your fans are too loud at full speed, and you want control:

You’re better off using the motherboard’s onboard fan headers for critical fans (CPU, rear exhaust, etc).

Use the fan extension card only for extra case fans, preferably low-RPM ones that won’t scream at full speed.
