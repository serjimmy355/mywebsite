            <p>This was my first project ended up in me building a PWA that I could use to easily find live train times when travelling to and from university.</p>
            <p>I initially started this with the thought that it would be a simple project, simply linking a webpage to an API and then visiting a bookmarked webpage. I soon realised that this wasn't quite what I needed and with the help of AI it appeared that I would need to build a PWA using Python.</p>
             <p>You can view the live application by clicking the image or visiting <a href="https://tt.thejimross.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tt.thejimross.com</a>.</p>

            <p>This project initially was to build a server to store personal files that I could access over the internet.</p> 
            <p>Shortly after getting this up and running I wondered if it was possible to integrate an office suite so I could edit files online for convenience. After researching I found that OnlyOffice was a suitable choice for this as there was a lot of documentation online and with it being open source, it wouldn't cost me anything.</p>

            <p>The very website you are browsing now represents my first iteration of a personal portfolio. The primary goal was to create a clean, responsive, and accessible platform to showcase my skills, projects, and journey into the IT industry.</p>
            <h4>Key Features:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Responsive design adapting to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.</li>
              <li>Interactive modal windows for quick project overviews.</li>
              <li>Multi-page structure for detailed "About Me" and "Projects" sections.</li>
              <li>Custom CSS styling with a consistent colour scheme and typography.</li>
              <li>JavaScript for dynamic functionalities like modal pop-ups.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project was an excellent learning experience in front-end development, from initial design concepts to final deployment. It has allowed me to solidify my understanding of HTML structure, CSS layout techniques, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.</p>
